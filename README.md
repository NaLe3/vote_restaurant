# README

An application that allows colleagues/friends to select a list of restaurants and vote to determine where they will have lunch. 

## Usage (V0)

It starts here: Restaurant Choice App (https://restaurantchoice.herokuapp.com/)

Anyone can create a session of restaurant vote. 
Once it started (after clicking on "DÃ©marrer une session de vote de restaurant"), the new URL has to be shared with friends/colleagues. Then everyone that is aware of the url, can select restaurants and vote for restaurants.
